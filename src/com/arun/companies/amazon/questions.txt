1. Create a HashMap to store Integer key value pairs

3. first question: to a string, is a novel content, such as "Jimmy has an apple, - Done
it is on the table" to give an exclude word list, such as "an" "a" "is" "the",
Let you give the most frequently occurring word in this string. 1point3acres.com/bbs

4. Given a log file, ListEach element represents a log file line. Inside each element, there are substrings. - Done
They are separated by spaces. For example, "a1ws efg7 i90s", String contains only letters and numbers,
the first substring is id, and the substring following id is given. Log file sort, the letters in the top.

5. Given a String of the for "1 5 9 + D C 3" + = add last two numbers, D = multiply last number by 2, - Done
 C = remove one number, At the end add all the remaining numbers

6. Given an Employee tree(CEO node) and two employees find the first common manager - Done

7. Given a list of unique integers, construct the binary tree by given order without rebalancing, then find out the distance between two nodes.

10. Each movie has a rate, and then there is a list of movies that are similar to this movie .
    For example, a movie has a bcd and he is similar to it. b There are similar clk,. . . Then these similarly formed a network, giving a movie number, giving it the top k movie in the network.

12. Given a string S, you are allowed to convert it to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation.

    For example:

    Given aacecaaa, return aaacecaaa.

    Given abcd, return dcbabcd. http://wdxtub.com/interview/14520595479135.html

13. My first question is valid parentheses. Use a stack

14. 1. Given a length of l, find all substrings of length 1 in a string. String characters cannot be repeated. The double pointer O(n) sweeps once, then adds a hash map or trie ïŒ² 2. A string, each character representing a scene. Between two identical characters is considered to be a continuous scene. For example: abcda, you can think of these five characters as the same scene. Or acafghbeb can think of two aca and beb scenes. If there is a coincidence between the scenes, then the scenes are combined. For example, abcab, where abca and bcab are coincident, then the five characters are considered to be the same scene. Give a string to find the longest scene. This is actually to find multiple ranges, and then find the longest link

Coding:
1. find the smallest element in a BST
2. find the inorder successor of a node in a BST
3. determine whether a BT is a BST
Design:
1.a data structure to store a word and its definition
2.what if the data is too big, how could you do?
3.a data structure to improve the performance of query a range of word
